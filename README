# Use cases book

This is a little web application for managing uses cases for a project.
It is more like an exercise than a real project.

It uses the following the dependecies:

* Boostrap
* KnockoutJS as a MVVM and templating framework.
* Coffeescript as the main language.
* Express as the web framework.
* SQLite3 for the database
* JQuery
* Gulp as the tasks runner

I know this stack is not ideal, but it works for the purposes of this project.
