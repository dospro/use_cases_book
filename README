# Use cases book

This is a little web application for managing uses cases for a project.
It is more like an exercise than a real project.

It uses the following the dependencies:

* Coffeescript as the main language.
* Node.js and Express for the backend
* Bootstrap (CSS only)
* Vue.js 2
* Sequelize ORM with a SQLite3 database
* Axios for ajax calls
* es6-promise to polyfill Promise
* Gulp as the tasks runner
* Webpack

This is still a work in progress.
